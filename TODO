- [ ] tighten errors using thiserror
- [ ] broaden oauth implementation
  - [ ] verify that we work with google, too (PCKE!)
  - [ ] ... and okta/auth0
- [ ] user storage
  - this is the place where we decide if a GoogleUser or a GitHub user or whatever _can_ act as a user for this
    system
  - as such, we need the Authenticator to return "rich" user objects -- anything that can be turned _into_ a Regi user,
    but not necessarily a Regi user from the get-go.
- [ ] package storage
  - right now we provide remote and cache read-through
    - remote really _ought_ to rewrite package tarball urls on packuments as they come through
    - ALSO: remote _should_ apply the same "accept/reject" package policy to remote packages as is applied to "local" published packages
- [ ] wasm plugin support
  - wasm plugins for package storage and user storage AT THE LEAST
- [ ] deno support
- [ ] docker support?
- [ ] web browser file browsing
- [ ] operationalization
  - can we embed this in an envoy?
  - can we provide dockerfiles?
  - configurator
    - provide aws secret manager
    - provide vault
    - provide json/yaml/xml/toml to set up server oauth
  - packagestorage
    - provide aws s3/gcs/cloudflare r2

- [ ] style login page
